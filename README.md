# Invasion hologenomics
Repository of the invasion hologenomics project. <br> 
**Aim:** this project aims to investigate whether metagenomic plasticity plays a role in biological invasions, i.e., whether invasive species may be able to quickly adapt to their new environment and oust native species thanks to a higher diversity and/or dynamism of their gut microbial community. <br>
**Study system & design:** we generated microbiome data from native Eurasian red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) and invasive North American Eastern grey squirrels (_S. carolinensis_) introduced to Italy, and will explore their variation along a natural-urban gradient and across seasons. Grey squirrels have been introduced to Italy from the 20th century, their populations are expanding and heir presence leads to the local extinction of native red squirrels mainly through exploitation competition for food. The species is currently subjected to mandatory control under the EU and national law. <br>
**Methods overview:** squirrels were live-trapped in twelve different sites located in northern Italy: two urban populations, two seminatural populations and two natural populations per species. Squirrels were individually marked and trapping was carried out three times per site: a spring-summer session (March-June), an autumn session (September-November) and a winter session (December-February) to gather longitudinal data at the individual level. At each sampling occasion, event data (i.e., location and date) and squirrel data (i.e., ID, sex, age class, weight, reproductive conditions) were recorded and faecal samples were collected to generate microbiome data through shotgun metagenomics. Additionally, squirrels were subjected to on-field behavioural tests (i.e., Open Field test and Mirror Image Stimulation) to gather individual personality data, and faecal samples will be used to generate diet and parasite data.
